üí° The Hackathon Journey & Submission 
‚Ä¢	Problem Addressed: PCOS often goes undiagnosed for years. My goal was to create an accessible, non-invasive screening tool to prompt early consultation and provide proactive lifestyle guidance, enabling users to take immediate, informed action.
‚Ä¢	Innovation & Impact: I rapidly integrated a trained ML model with a feat of full-stack integration completed within the hackathon timeline. This provided users with a complete solution: immediate, actionable insights that span from prediction to prevention. The project showcases my ability to deliver a complex, high-impact application single-handedly.
üöß Status & Data Disclaimer
‚Ä¢	It's important to be transparent that the current version is a highly polished prototype.
The current demo features a fully designed and interactive front-end that demonstrates the precise user flow, data input mechanism, prediction visualization, and personalized diet output. The core Machine Learning model was trained on a small, public domain dataset for demonstration purposes only. The true potential lies in the workflow and dynamic UI/UX, showing how the application would function at scale with sufficient clinical data.
